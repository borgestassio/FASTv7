FAST v7.02.00d-bjj - Used for Linearization

The FAST v7.02.00d-bjj is avaible from the NREL (https://nwtc.nrel.gov/FAST), I don't have any connections with NREL personnel and the files here can, and should, be downloaded in their original form on their website.
The intention of this repository is to ease the linearization proccess in order to calculate the control matrices to implement the controllers described by A.D. Wright and L.J. Fingersh in Advanced Control Design for Wind Turbines (http://www.mapcruzin.com/wind-power-publications/research-development/42437.pdf), as the Techinical Report uses a CART Wind Turbine, model no longer available to follow the instructions, I felt the need to create a guide to help others.
